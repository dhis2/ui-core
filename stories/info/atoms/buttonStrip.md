# ButtonStrip

A ButtonStrip is a framing element that can be used to layout an inline set of `Buttons`. This component will only accept instances of the `Button` component as its children and requires at least 2 children.

## Usage

In its default configuration, the `ButtonStrip` will add 16px of whitespace between the buttons, and it will align them on the left (flex-start). In `compact` mode it will keep the buttons directly adjacent to each other and remove some borders and border-radius, so that the strip of buttons appear as a single entity. The `buttonStrip` can be aligned at the `start`, `middle`, or `end` of the container.
