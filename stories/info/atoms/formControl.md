# FormControl

This is a very basic component that can wrap form fields. It serves two purposes:

1. Field spacing: adds some margin-bottom
1. HTML structure: When composing form components, you usually end up with a number of sibling elements, i.e. a label, and input, and a help-text. These can be wrapped in a FormControl so there is a clear distinction between form components.
