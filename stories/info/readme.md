# DHIS2 Design System
This is the temporary home for the DHIS2 Design System while it is under development. The design system consists of principles to guide design of DHIS2 applications, as well as a library of flexible, reusable ui components.

## Design Principles
* [Typography](principles/typography.md)
* [Color](principles/color.md)
* [Spacing & Alignment](principles/spacing-alignment.md)
* [Content & Communication](principles/content-communication.md)
* [Icons](principles/icons.md)

## Components
The DHIS2 ui component system is based on atomic design principles, reducing components into reusable atoms and molecules. Each component has recommended usages.
### Atoms
* [Button](atoms/button.md)
* [Card](atoms/card.md)
* [Checkbox](atoms/checkbox.md)
* [Chip](atoms/chip.md)
* [Elevation](atoms/elevation.md)
* Input field
* Menu
* Progress
* [Radio button](atoms/radio.md)
* Select
* Switch
* [Tooltip](atoms/tooltip.md)

### Molecules
* [Comment](molecules/comment.md)
* [Modal](molecules/modal.md)
* [Popover](molecules/popover.md)
* Tree

### Organisms
* [Header Bar](organisms/header-bar.md)
* [Table](organisms/table.md)
