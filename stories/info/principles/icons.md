# Icons
## Icon Library

The open source [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) are available for use in d2. This large library gives access to icons across varied subject matter. The 'outlined' style of icon is used by default. Custom icons can be used where necessary, these should be made specifically for purpose by a designer.

## Using Icons

Icons are used in DHIS2 apps as supplemental information. They help the user to understand an interface at a glance and can help give context to information.

Icons for primary actions and information should not be used without a label. There are very few icons that are universally understood, always using icons are supplemental information avoids ambiguity. If an icon is used alone for a secondary action, ensure it displays an informative tooltip on hover.

![example of a button using an icon with and without label](../images/icon-button.jpg)
*The action is ambiguous without a label, it could be rewind, refresh, rotate, undo, turn, step back...*

Icon use should always be consistent. Using an icon for 'period' can help the user to visually track down all 'period' elements, for example. Without this icon the user would need to parse each individual item.

*The icons here let the user know quickly that Item 2 and Item 5 are of the same type, and that that type probably has something to do with time. This makes list scanning must easier.*
