# ToggleGroup

The ToggleGroup is a simple wrapper component that takes care of alignment and spacing of a set of "toggle" inputs. By default, the inputs will be displayed inline, but by adding the `stacked` prop, they will appear stacked. The ToggleGroup only accepts the following components as children:

-   Radio
-   Checkbox
-   Switch
