# Select Field

This is a rich select field, allowing to show errors,
hint texts and well as validity states like valid, warning and error.
The `list` property supports a second level, which will be rendered as
optgroup. Right now, the parent option will be rendered as a choosalbe option
as well and it's label will be the label for the optgroup.
